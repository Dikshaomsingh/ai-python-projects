As research continues in the development of self-driving cars, one of the key challenges is computer vision, allowing these cars to develop an understanding of their environment from digital images. In particular, this involves the ability to recognize and distinguish road signs â€“ stop signs, speed limit signs, yield signs, and more.

In this project, TensorFlow is used to build a neural network to classify road signs based on an image of those signs.

Attempt 1 : one convoluted layer of 3 by 3 kernal and one pooling layer of 2 by 2, 128 hidden layer with 50% dropout rate. Output accuracy around 50%.

Attempt 2 : two convoluted layer of 3 by 3 kernal and two pooling layer of 2 by 2, 128 hidden layer with 50% dropout rate. Output accuracy around 89%.

Attempt 3 : two convoluted layer of 3 by 3 kernal and two pooling layer of 2 by 2, 228 hidden layer with 50% dropout rate. Output accuracy around 96%.
